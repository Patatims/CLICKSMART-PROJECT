    "What is a DDoS attack?": "A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a type of cyberattack that floods a website, network, or server with excessive traffic, making it slow or completely unavailable to real users.\n✅ \tDistributed Attack – The attack comes from multiple compromised devices, forming a botnet controlled by hackers.\n✅ \tDenial of Service – The goal is to overload the target’s resources, preventing legitimate users from accessing services.\n✅ \tCommon Targets – DDoS attacks often target business websites, banks, gaming servers, and government platforms.\nDDoS attacks don’t steal data, but they can cause financial losses and reputational damage.",
    "How does a DDoS attack work?": "A DDoS attack works by overwhelming a website or network with fake traffic, preventing real users from accessing it.\n\nStep 1: Botnet Formation – Hackers infect multiple computers, servers, or IoT devices with malware, turning them into zombies that can be controlled remotely.\nStep 2: Attack Execution – The botnet sends a massive number of requests to the target’s website or server, consuming its bandwidth and computing power.\nStep 3: System Overload – The target system slows down or crashes, leading to downtime and disruptions.\nSome DDoS attacks use \"amplification techniques\" to make a small attack appear much larger, making them harder to stop.",
    "Why do hackers launch DDoS attacks?": "Hackers launch DDoS attacks for various reasons, including financial gain, activism, or revenge.\n\n✅ \tExtortion & Ransom (DDoS-for-Hire) – Some hackers demand ransom payments in exchange for stopping an attack.\n✅ \tHacktivism (Political or Social Motives) – Groups like Anonymous use DDoS attacks to protest governments, corporations, or policies.\n✅ \tCompetitor Sabotage – Businesses may hire cybercriminals to disrupt rival companies’ services.\n✅ \tRevenge or Disruption – Angry users, former employees, or trolls launch DDoS attacks to cause chaos or seek retaliation.\n✅ \tTesting Cybersecurity – Some hackers use DDoS attacks to find vulnerabilities in a system’s defense.\nDDoS attacks are illegal in most countries and can lead to severe penalties.",
    "What are the different types of DDoS attacks?": "DDoS attacks can be categorized into three main types:\n\n1️⃣  Volumetric Attacks:\n- Goal: Overwhelm the target's bandwidth with massive data traffic.\n- Methods: Flooding the target with high volumes of data packets, such as UDP floods or ICMP floods.\n- Impact: Causes network congestion, leading to service disruption.\n- Example: A botnet sending a large number of requests to exhaust the target's bandwidth.\n\n2️⃣  Protocol Attacks:\n- Goal: Exploit weaknesses in network protocols to consume server resources.\n- Methods: Attacks like SYN floods or Ping of Death that misuse protocol operations.\n- Impact: Exhausts server resources, making the service unresponsive.\n- Example: Sending malformed packets that cause the server to crash.\n\n3️⃣  Application-Layer Attacks:\n- Goal: Target specific applications to disrupt services.\n- Methods: Sending legitimate-looking requests to overwhelm application processes.\n- Impact: Crashes the application, affecting user experience.\n- Example: HTTP floods that mimic real user behavior to exhaust application resources.",
    "What is a volumetric DDoS attack?": "A volumetric DDoS attack aims to overwhelm a target's network bandwidth by flooding it with massive amounts of data.\n\nMechanism:\n- Attackers use botnets to send a high volume of traffic to the target.\n- Common methods include UDP floods and ICMP floods.\n- The excessive traffic consumes the target's bandwidth, leading to network congestion.\n\nImpact:\n- Legitimate users experience slow connections or complete service outages.\n- The target's network becomes unresponsive due to the traffic overload.\n\nVolumetric attacks are measured in bits per second (bps) and are among the most common DDoS attacks.",

    "How do I avoid fake giveaways and lottery scams on social media": "Stay safe from fake giveaways and lottery scams! Follow these tips:\n✅ \tVerify the Page or Account – Only trust giveaways from verified accounts with official checkmarks. Fake ones often have few followers and recent activity.\n✅ \tNever Pay to Claim a Prize – Legitimate giveaways never ask for fees, deposits, or shipping payments to claim a prize.\n✅ \tBeware of Urgent Messages – Scammers use phrases like \"Claim your prize NOW!\" to pressure victims into acting fast.\n✅ \tCheck for Fake Comments & Bots – Scammers use fake accounts to create false excitement. Always research first!\nIf it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!",
    "How do I spot a fake job offer?": "Watch out for these red flags in job offers:\n✅ \tToo Good to Be True – If a job promises high pay for little work, it's likely a scam.\n✅ \tUnsolicited Job Offers – If you never applied, but they offer you a job, be cautious!\n✅ \tNo Company Information – Legitimate jobs have a verifiable website, email, and company details.\n✅ \tThey Ask for Personal or Banking Info – Real employers don’t ask for sensitive details upfront.\n✅ \tUpfront Fees – If they ask for training fees, background checks, or admin costs, it's a scam!\nRule of Thumb: If they ask for money before hiring you, it’s a scam!",
    "How do loan scams work, and how can I avoid them?": "Loan scams trick people into giving money or personal info. Here’s how they work:\n✅ \tUpfront Fees – Scammers demand an \"application fee\" before approving your loan. Legit lenders never do this!\n✅ \tGuaranteed Approval – No credit check? It’s a scam! Real lenders verify your credit history first.\n✅ \tHigh-Pressure Tactics – If they say \"Apply now or lose your chance!\", they’re trying to scam you.\n✅ \tUnregistered Lenders – Check if they’re licensed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nTip: Never pay before getting a loan. Legit loans deduct fees from the loan amount, not upfront!",
    "What should I do if a scammer asks me to pay a fee for a job or loan?": "If someone asks for a payment before giving you a job or loan, do this:\n✅ \tStop Communicating – Do not send money and block the scammer immediately.\n✅ \tReport the Scam – File a complaint with PNP Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) if it’s a fake lender.\n✅ \tCheck Your Bank or E-Wallet – If you already paid, contact GCash, PayMaya, or your bank to report fraud.\n✅ \tWarn Others – Share scam details on social media to prevent others from getting scammed.\nRule of Thumb: No legitimate employer or lender asks for upfront payments!",
    "How do I check if an online shopping website is legit?": "Before buying, check if an online store is legit! Here’s how:\n✅ \tLook for HTTPS & Security Badges – A secure website starts with \"https://\" and has a lock icon in the address bar.\n✅ \tVerify Seller Reviews & Ratings – Search \"[Website Name] scam\" to see if others have reported fraud.\n✅ \tCheck Contact Information – Legit stores have real customer service numbers and emails, not just a contact form.\n✅ \tWatch for Unrealistic Discounts – If the price is too good to be true, it probably is!\n✅ \tTest the Return Policy – Fake sites often have no refund or return process.\nRule of Thumb: If you can’t find the store’s reputation online, don’t risk your money!",
    "What are the signs of a fake Lazada, Shopee, or Facebook Marketplace seller?": "Watch out for these red flags when buying online!\n✅ \tNo Verified Badge (Lazada/Shopee Mall) – Trusted sellers have official store badges on their profile.\n✅ \tUnusual Payment Requests – Fake sellers ask for direct bank transfers or GCash payments instead of COD.\n✅ \tToo Many Stock Photos, No Real Pictures – Scammers use stolen product images instead of actual photos.\n✅ \tPoor Reviews or No Reviews at All – A lack of reviews or too many generic \"5-star\" ratings are suspicious.\n✅ \tFake Sense of Urgency – If the seller insists \"Only 1 left! Message me now!\", be cautious!\nTip: Always buy from verified or high-rated sellers to avoid scams.",
    "How can I get a refund if I was scammed by an online seller?": "If you got scammed, act fast!
