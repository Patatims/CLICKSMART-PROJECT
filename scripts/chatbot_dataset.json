    "What is a DDoS attack?": "<ul><p>A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a type of cyberattack that floods a website, network, or server with excessive traffic, making it slow or completely unavailable to real users.</p><li>Distributed Attack – The attack comes from multiple compromised devices, forming a botnet controlled by hackers.</li><li>Denial of Service – The goal is to overload the target’s resources, preventing legitimate users from accessing services.</li><li>Common Targets – DDoS attacks often target business websites, banks, gaming servers, and government platforms.</li><p>DDoS attacks don’t steal data, but they can cause financial losses and reputational damage.</p></ul>",
    "How does a DDoS attack work?": "<p>A DDoS attack works by overwhelming a website or network with fake traffic, preventing real users from accessing it.</p><p></p><p>Step 1: Botnet Formation – Hackers infect multiple computers, servers, or IoT devices with malware, turning them into zombies that can be controlled remotely.</p><p>Step 2: Attack Execution – The botnet sends a massive number of requests to the target’s website or server, consuming its bandwidth and computing power.</p><p>Step 3: System Overload – The target system slows down or crashes, leading to downtime and disruptions.</p><p>Some DDoS attacks use \"amplification techniques\" to make a small attack appear much larger, making them harder to stop.</p>",
    "Why do hackers launch DDoS attacks?": "<ul><p>Hackers launch DDoS attacks for various reasons, including financial gain, activism, or revenge.</p><p></p><li>Extortion & Ransom (DDoS-for-Hire) – Some hackers demand ransom payments in exchange for stopping an attack.</li><li>Hacktivism (Political or Social Motives) – Groups like Anonymous use DDoS attacks to protest governments, corporations, or policies.</li><li>Competitor Sabotage – Businesses may hire cybercriminals to disrupt rival companies’ services.</li><li>Revenge or Disruption – Angry users, former employees, or trolls launch DDoS attacks to cause chaos or seek retaliation.</li><li>Testing Cybersecurity – Some hackers use DDoS attacks to find vulnerabilities in a system’s defense.</li><p>DDoS attacks are illegal in most countries and can lead to severe penalties.</p></ul>",
